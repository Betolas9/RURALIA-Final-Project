# RURALIA-Final-Project
🌿 Sustainable Rural Tourism in Portugal
This project was developed as my University Final Project with the goal of transforming rural tourism in Portugal into a more sustainable and engaging experience through gamification.
We worked as a team of six, which allowed us to collaborate effectively and apply agile methodologies throughout the project.

📋 Project Objective:
Our objective was to enhance the rural tourism experience by implementing a system that motivates tourists to engage with local activities and cultures in a sustainable way. By integrating gamification elements, we created an interactive platform where users are rewarded for eco-friendly actions, local participation, and sustainable travel habits.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
* Flutter for building the mobile application, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface
* Flask for the backend API, providing fast and scalable server-side functionality
* SQL for managing the database and storing user information and activity logs
* Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, enabling seamless deployment and scaling across various environments

🚀 Features:
* Gamification: Points, badges, and challenges to incentivize eco-friendly behavior
* Local engagement: Interactive maps and guides to promote participation in rural activities
* Sustainability-focused: Encourages users to reduce their carbon footprint while traveling

This project showcases a blend of mobile development, backend infrastructure, and cloud deployment skills, offering a sustainable solution for enhancing tourism in rural Portugal.
